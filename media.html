<div class="content">
<p>Colorado isn’t likely to climb much out of the cellar in nationwide rankings of per-student funding for higher education anytime soon, but a $100 million investment from the General Assembly should be a good start.</p>

<p>Wednesday, the Senate Education Committee took testimony on Senate Bill 14-001, which would put $100 million into higher education, an increase that begins to remedy the general fund cuts to higher education over the past decade. The bill designates $40 million for state-funded, need-based financial aid, $8.3 million for the college opportunity fund vouchers, $49.3 million into fee-for-service funding, and the balance into support for local district junior colleges and area vocational schools. SB 1 contains a 6 percent limit on tuition increases for 2014-15.</p>

<p>The committee will bring the bill back for amendments and a vote on Feb. 6.</p>

<p>In 2000, Colorado provided 68 percent of the funding for students to go to public colleges; the students were responsible for 32 percent of their college costs. Today, that figure has flipped: 69 percent is now borne by the students and their parents, and 31 percent comes from the state. “We cannot continue to shift the costs to students and parents,” said Frank Watrous of the Bell Policy Center, who testified in favor of SB 1 Wednesday.</p>

<p>Usually, changes to the state’s higher ed budget are done through the Long Appropriations Bill, but sponsors defended the use of a separate bill for the increase Wednesday. Co-sponsor Sen. Andy Kerr, D-Lakewood, told the committee that he chairs that it’s about accountability. “It means we are trying to bring attention as much as possible to the reinvestment in higher education… and at the same time hold instructions accountable” by lowering the tuition limit, he said. Putting the $100 million into the budget through the Long bill might not make such an increase as obvious, he added.</p>

<p>For the past several years, public colleges and universities have had authority from SB 10-003 to raise tuition by up to 9 percent, but they also had permission under that bill to seek higher increases through a waiver to the Colorado Commission on Higher Education. All but one institution, the Colorado School of Mines, obtained those waivers, so 27 out of 28 colleges and universities had permission to exceed the 9 percent cap.</p>

<p>The 6 percent tuition limit in SB 1 didn’t play as well for a couple of the committee’s Republican members. Sen. Mark Scheffel, R-Parker, said he thought the 6 percent limit was arbitrary and would prefer an increase tied to the rate of inflation. On the other hand, “perhaps we’re injecting ourselves into an area where we don’t belong,” an area that he said belongs under the authority of the college and university presidents and their boards.</p>

<p>Colorado Mesa University President Tim Foster deferred to the authority of the General Assembly. “The state is the owner of 28 institutions, as you make an investment, your voice and input are important… This kind of guidance we take seriously.”</p>

<p>While the $100 million boost will help, it’s a far cry from the highpoint of higher education funding in the past decade, and doesn’t even meet a statutory requirement set in 2004.</p>

<p>Under the legislation that created the College Opportunity Fund, the General Assembly was required to increase general fund support by a formula based on inflation and enrollment. Lt. Gov. Joe Garcia, who heads the Department of Higher Education and is a former president of Adams State College, said that if the Legislature made that kind of increase this year, it would cost almost another $100 million.</p>

<p>Students packed the hearing room during testimony Wednesday. Several community college students said they are paying their own way through college. Raenn Acosta, a student at the Community College of Denver, said some of her high school classmates chose to go into the workforce directly after high school rather than go to college because of the “outrageous” cost.</p>

<p>No one testified against SB 1, although Watrous, from the Bell Policy Center, said the $5 million targeted for merit aid ought to go to need-based aid instead, a recommendation also made by the Joint Budget Committee staff in a December briefing document on higher education issues. Merit aid equals options, Watrous said; need-based aid equals opportunity.</p>

<p>Watrous also addressed the issue of student debt, in response to a question from new Sen. Rachel Zenzinger, D-Arvada. Student debt is a significant issue in every state, he said. Some students make decisions on degree programs based on what the jobs will pay after graduation, and this results in students not choosing to go into areas needed “for the continuation of the social fabric” because those jobs don’t pay as well, Watrous explained.</p>

<p>According to the Project on Student Debt, in 2012 Colorado students averaged $24,540 in college loan debt at graduation, and 52 percent of those graduating from state colleges and universities leave with debt. The national average is around $29,400, with seven in 10 students graduating with debt. Student loan debt increases at 6 percent per year.</p>

<p>SB 1 doesn’t solve every affordability issue, but it’s a step in the right direction, said Kerr in a press conference with reporters earlier this month. Co-sponsor Sen. Cheri Jahn, D-Wheat Ridge, said the bill is important to her because of its impact on her community. Students at one of her local high schools tell her that they can’t afford to go to college, yet a majority of the jobs in the future will require a college degree. “If we really want to help the middle class, you make sure everybody has access to higher education,” whether at a two-year or four-year college or a technical institution.</p>

<p>Kerr told <em>The Colorado Statesman</em> earlier this week that SB 1 isn’t designed to “rectify all the wrongs done to higher education financing” over the last decade. “It is designed to finally stop the pendulum” from swinging in the direction of more cuts and higher tuition increases. “This puts a stop to the out-of-control spiraling of tuition, and while it doesn’t reverse as much as we would like, it slows the growth of tuition and starts restoring some of the funds that have been cut.”</p>

<p>In that same interview, Jahn said the bill is just a first step in addressing higher education affordability. This “is about the middle class and lower income students,” she told <em>The Statesman</em>. “It’s the start of the discussion.” Jahn also said the bill is not only intended to address the funding for larger higher education institutions, but it also is about helping rural colleges.</p>

<p>Kerr and Jahn pointed out that all resident students will qualify for COF increases, proposed at $8.3 million. Currently, the COF voucher is worth $64 per credit hour, with a maximum of $1,920 per 30-credit hour year. Based on enrollment of 138,855 students listed in the 2013 Long Bill, $8.3 million would increase the COF by $2 per hour, or $60 per year.</p>

<p>Last week, the Colorado Commission on Higher Education released its annual tuition and fee report. It shows resident undergraduate tuition and fees ranging from a low of $1,860 for 30 credit hours at Colorado Mountain College, to $10,347 at CU-Boulder and $16,485 for the Colorado School of Mines. Based on 2013-14 rates, a 6 percent increase in tuition only at Colorado Mountain College would be $100.80; at CU-Boulder it would be $483.36 and at Mines, $815.40.</p>

<p>In 2010, Colorado ranked 50th nationally in state support for its research universities (CU-Boulder and Colorado State University-Fort Collins), according to the National Science Foundation. Overall, the state ranked 48th in per-student state funding for its public colleges and universities, according to a 2011 University of Colorado report.</p>

Andy Kerr, D-Jefferson County said.</p>

<p style="margin: 0px 0px 15px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); line-height: 23px; color: rgb(44, 45, 46); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Kerr says wildfires will happen. The laws passed — more than a half dozen this year — are focused on lessening their intensity by reducing their fuel.</p>

<p style="margin: 0px 0px 15px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); line-height: 23px; color: rgb(44, 45, 46); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">“When I’ve talked to folks who live in the red zone, the number one reason they say have not done mitigation is time and the cost to them out of pocket,” Kerr said.</p>

<p style="margin: 0px 0px 15px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); line-height: 23px; color: rgb(44, 45, 46); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Lawmakers re-authorized a 2008 bill that provides tax credits for 50 percent of a homeowners mitigation costs up to $2,500. But that only helps so much if neighbors don’t mitigate as well. So they passed another law aimed at helping entire communities do mitigation. It provides nearly $10 million in matching grants for not only local governments, but homeowners associations.</p>

<p style="margin: 0px 0px 15px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); line-height: 23px; color: rgb(44, 45, 46); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">“Ultimately what that means is we’ll be putting almost $20 million worth of work on the ground,” Lisa Dale with the Department of Natural Resources said.</p>

<p style="margin: 0px 0px 15px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); line-height: 23px; color: rgb(44, 45, 46); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">That kind of large scale mitigation is what lawmakers hope will reduce the damage caused by fires.</p>

<p style="margin: 0px 0px 15px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); line-height: 23px; color: rgb(44, 45, 46); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">“It would be great if next summer we might hear about some small fires, but they don’t get blown up into the big ones kill people and destroy homes,” Kerr said.</p>

<p style="margin: 0px 0px 15px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); line-height: 23px; color: rgb(44, 45, 46); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">In addition to financial help, the state forest service offers information on everything from how to set up a community wildfire protection plan to fire-wise building materials and landscaping. A state forester will even come to homes to do an assessment of a home’s fire risk.</p>

<p>Democratic lawmakers on April 8 unveiled legislation aimed at promoting local hiring and putting in place penalties for contractors who outsource work involving state projects, when avoidable.</p>

<p>But, so far, the so-called Keep Jobs in Colorado Act has been met with uneasiness by representatives of the contracting field, who are expressing concern over key requirements of the legislation and worry that the bill could run up the cost of doing business with the state.</p>

<p>House Bill 1292 was announced at a Capitol press conference, where it was touted as a bill that will “reform state procurement,” the bidding process for state work projects.</p>

<p>Rep. Dan Pabon, D-Denver, said the legislation will “promote local hiring, domestic manufacturing, and will help stop the outsourcing of jobs with taxpayer money.”</p>

<p>“Our number one job is boosting our state’s economy and connecting more Coloradans to good jobs,” Pabon said. “One way to do that is to ensure that state funds, our taxpayer dollars, go to hire Colorado workers and support Colorado businesses.”</p>

<p>The bill would expand the state’s “best value” bidding process, to include factors beyond low bidding in awarding contracts, such as the availability of Colorado workers and whether domestic materials like iron and steel are being used for state-backed projects.</p>

<p>The bill also would put in place financial penalties for companies that do not meet a current legal threshold, which requires that 80 percent of all taxpayer-backed state project labor be conducted by Colorado workers.</p>

<p>Sen. Andy Kerr, D-Lakewood, said that the 80 percent requirement has been on the books since 1933, but that the jail penalty for company owners who do not abide by the law has not been enforced.</p>

<p>Kerr said the bill would replace jail time with financial penalties for companies that do not comply, with fees as high as $25,000 when violations are found.</p>

<p>“We are putting some teeth into a law that is already in existence,” Kerr said. “And we are making sure that it is feasible for it to be followed, as well.”</p>

<p>The bill takes a “three strikes and you’re out” approach to companies that do not comply with the law, which could result in a company no longer being able to do business with the state. Enforcement will be up to the state Department of Personnel and Administration and the state Department of Labor and Employment.</p>

<p>“If somebody violates those rules, there’s going to be consequences,” Pabon said.</p>

<p>But representatives of the contracting field were not exactly jumping out of their seats with excitement over the bill, during a legislative committee hearing that followed the press event.</p>

<p>Some had neutral positions on the bill, saying they just don’t know enough about the legislation or its cost to form an opinion at this time. But they did express concern over the 80 percent requirement, especially over how it’s enforced.</p>

<p>Some who testified said that, for example, it would be difficult for contractors to ensure they are working with Colorado-based materials.</p>

<p>“That’s a complicated process,” said Craig Clark of Dynaelectric, an electrical contracting company. “We have a tough enough time identifying a U.S. project.”</p>

<p>Republican members of the House State, Veterans and Military Affairs Committee also expressed concern that contractors would be penalized over things that would be difficult for them to control, such as whether those in the process are being honest about whether labor and materials are Colorado-based.</p>

<p>“There’s absolutely no way in this free market system that everyone is going to be truthful,” said Rep. Ray Scott, R-Grand Junction. “It gets into the weeds so deep and puts such a burden on a general contractor.”</p>

<p>The committee ran out of time during the hearing and will vote on the matter at another time.</p>

<p>It was like a dogfight at the Senate Education Committee on Thursday afternoon.</p>

<p>The battle to make dogs and cats adopted from shelter and rescue centers the official state pet pitted schoolkids against professional lobbyists representing purebred dog clubs, retailers, groomers and dog-show organizers.</p>

<p>The bill ultimately passed, 6-3, but there were moments when the students from Peakview School in Walsenburg thought their project, designed to help them learn about the legislative process, could go either way.</p>

<p>So many people arrived to testify that stragglers were left to find seats in the overflow room. Dog leashes stretched across the packed hallway, obstacles for the unwary, and piercing barks interrupted testimony. Griffin Kerr, the 3-year-old son of the bill's sponsor, Andy Kerr, D-Lakewood, cavorted around the room dressed as a spotted dog because his preschool had just celebrated Dalmatian Day.</p>

<p>And that was just the sideshow.</p>

<p>Testimony started with Roger Arellano, 14, who had arrived on a bus from Walsenburg with other middle-schoolers from Peakview who had been researching the bill.</p>

<p>"It's important to honor the voice of the voiceless," he said.</p>

<p>Speaking up on behalf of shelter and rescue dogs is "a matter of life and death" for millions of dogs and cats, he said. "And you can save a lot of money compared to getting them from a pet store."</p>

<p>This did not go over well with supporters of the pet industry.</p>

<p>"The language of the bill honors the transaction, saying the only qualified state pet is adopted from shelter and rescue," said Dan Anglin of Anglin Public Affairs.</p>

<p>Anglin represents the Colorado Federation of Dog Clubs, which holds dog shows, and the Colorado Pet Association, a group of animal retailers, groomers and breeders.</p>

<p>"The state already honors that with a license plate," said Anglin, who added that the economic impact of American Kennel Club purebred dog ownership in Colorado was an estimated $20.48 million each year.</p>

<p>There was another problem with the bill.</p>

<p>"It unfairly discriminates against birds, reptiles, arachnids and other mammals," he said. "And snakes, lizards and spiders."</p>

<p>Many opponents said the bill should focus on heroic dogs, such as service dogs, law enforcement dogs, cadaver dogs and military dogs.</p>

<p>Then, patriotism was invoked.</p>

<p>"We do our share too," said Karen Kotke-Partington, a member of the Norfolk Terrier Club. "When a puppy owner went to Iraq, we took care of the puppy," she said, adding that when the soldier returned, the dog meant everything to him.</p>

<p>Interloper Skyler Kuykendall, a fifth-grader at Rooney Ranch Elementary School in Lakewood, sought to amend the bill to include the golden retriever as the state dog.</p>

<p>With his golden retriever, Boz, at his side, he ticked off a list of reasons including "brown eyes like the Rocky Mountains" and "golden color that is like all of the gold that has been found in Colorado."</p>

<p>The Walsenburg students sat in the back, rapt at democracy in action.</p>

<p>"The argument swung between service dogs and shelter dogs," said Kaylee Summers, 14. "It was difficult to decide, because both sides made sense."</p>

<h1 class="title">Columbine Courier: Sen. Andy Kerr and constituents discuss variety of issues over appetizers and cocktails</h1>

<div class="content news-content">
<p>More than a dozen constituents braved snowy conditions Feb. 20 to share some appetizers with state Sen. Andy Kerr. But they wanted to share more than tapas — the South Jeffco residents at Q’s Pub &amp; Grille that chilly night wanted to hear the first-term Democrat’s opinions on a variety of topics, and to share their own.</p>

<p>While the gathering was billed as an education forum, the topics were not limited to education issues facing the legislature this year. The subject matter ranged from gun-control measures being considered at the Capitol to regulations on hydraulic fracturing near homes.</p>

<p>Unlike a typical town-hall format in which the politician is the center of attention while fielding questions, Kerr floated from table to table, entering the free-flowing discussions among the attendees.</p>

<p>“It’s better and more productive to talk to fellow citizens with different opinions,” said attendee Gary Landin.</p>

<p>Landin had been peppering Kerr with questions on subjects ranging from fracking to the looming federal government sequester funding cuts. But once Kerr had worked his way to another table, the conversation didn’t stop. Landin, along with Young Willingham and Tim Carlson, continued discussing the points brought up in their conversation with Kerr, who represents the newly redrawn Senate District 22 in South Jeffco.</p>

<p>“The national level of government is almost totally broken,” Carlson said. “Here (on the local level) is where you find the votes and get work done.”</p>

<p>All three men, who met for the first time at the event, said being able to share their ideas helped them feel like they weren’t just sitting on the sidelines.</p>

<p>“A free and proper exchange of ideas is a great thing,” Willingham said. “As long as you do it with respect.”</p>

<p>While the answers to the nation’s problems weren’t necessarily hashed out in one evening, Landin said it beat the alternative.</p>

<p>“It’s better than (complaining) in your kitchen by yourself,” Landin said.</p>

<p class="introduction">Colorado lawmakers wrapped up a special session Wednesday with little to show for returning to work. It was an extraordinary session, with quite ordinary results. "After what happened last week, it was extremely important that we come back and do the work we were sent here to do," said Democratic Rep. Andy Kerr.</p>

<p class="introduction">When governors sign bills, they typically give the signing pens to the bill sponsors to honor their roles in creating the new laws. But on Tuesday, Rep. Andy Kerr, D-Lakewood, and Sen. Ted Harvey, R-Highlands Ranch, were walking around the Capitol with their “veto pens” — the pens that Gov. John Hickenlooper used to veto Senate Bill 124. Of course, Harvey, who was the bill’s sponsor, and Kerr, who was the bill’s loudest opponent in the House, had different perspectives on the writing instruments.</p>
